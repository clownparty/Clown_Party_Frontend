<h1>Pok&eacute;Team Builder</h1>
<p>Pok&eacute;Team Builder allows you to build out, edit, and, if desired, delete teams of six pok&eacute;mon. You can also view those created by other users. </p>
<p>So far only the first 150 Pok&eacute;mon are available. In the future, we would like to include the remaining 608 pok&eacute;mon, types, flavor text, and user bios. A random team display (in which a random team pulled from the database would be displayed) would also be a neat thing to add, as would a random team generator (in which six random pok&eacute;mon would be placed in a team). Eventually, the ability to give your pok&eacute;mon moves would be a good addition.</p>
